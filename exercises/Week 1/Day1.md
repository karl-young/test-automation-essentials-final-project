# Day 1 Exercises: Functional and Black Box Testing

## Instructions

Using the provided acceptance criteria, your task is to create detailed test cases for each of the functionalities described. Follow these steps for each exercise:

1. **Identify Test Scenarios**: Based on the acceptance criteria, identify different test scenarios that need to be validated. Consider both positive and negative test cases.
2. **Define Test Steps**: Outline the steps required to execute each test scenario, including the initial setup, actions to perform, and expected outcomes.
3. **Determine Expected Results**: Clearly specify the expected results for each test case. This includes verifying outputs, error messages, and any changes to the system state.
4. **Document Test Cases**: Create a document listing all test cases in a structured format, including test case ID, title, description, steps, and expected results.
