# Lets practice what we learned about STLC and OOP.

## Instructions

Please answer the following questions about the application of STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the context of Automation Testing:

1. How can Automated testing, from what you know at this point, help on each STLC stage?

 From what i understand at this point It can save loads of time on writing test cases by using tools like gherkin.
 but i don't know a lot about it at this point and i would like to know more.

2. What do you disagree with the most about the STLC principles? Why?

3. Explain the importance of modularity and reusability in automation testing, and how OOP principles support these concepts.

 It is important to have reusable and modular code it can save time and effort. Not only that but it can also make the code more maintainable. classes can be used in multiple places and can be reused.

4. How does a conditional statement in programming looks in two different languages such as Python and Java? What do you observe?
 
 They can look similar but have different syntax but can do the same thing.

5. If you had to sell automated testing to a project right now...what would you say to convince them?

 At this point im not sure.

Please provide as much detail on each answer as you want, without any pressure. This is a great opportunity to reflect on the concepts you've learned and how they can be applied in practice. Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences on these topics.
